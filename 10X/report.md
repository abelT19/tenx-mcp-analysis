# Tenx MCP Setup Report

## What I Did
- Configured VS Code with the Tenx MCP Analysis server.
- Authenticated MCP using my GitHub account.
- Enabled Copilot Agent mode and verified background logging.
- Created and refined Copilot rules in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

## What Worked
- MCP authentication via GitHub worked smoothly.
- Agent mode respected the custom rules after updating instructions.
- Clear rules improved response structure and code quality.

## What Didn’t Work
- Initially confused MCP server type (SSE vs HTTP).
- Difficulty locating Agent mode and MCP tools panel.

## How I Troubleshot
- Re-read Tenx MCP documentation carefully.
- Restarted MCP server and re-authenticated with GitHub.
- Tested agent behavior after each rules update.

## Insights Gained
- Rules strongly influence AI behavior and response quality.
- Clear constraints and preferences reduce unnecessary verbosity.
- Agent mode combined with MCP enables measurable human–AI collaboration.
